# WebDriver binaries managed by webdriver-manager (often downloaded to user home or project)
# If ChromeDriverManager downloads to project root, ignore them.
# Common paths for WebDriverManager downloads:
# ~/.wdm/
# If you explicitly save the driver executable in your project root, add its name here.
# For example, if you save it as 'chromedriver' in your project root:
# chromedriver
# geckodriver
